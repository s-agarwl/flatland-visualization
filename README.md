# Flatland Visualization

This project aims to visualize episodes of flatland environment. 

Note: If you want to just want to see the visualization without the ability to upload your log files, please visit: https://vis-tools.paluno.uni-due.de/fv/

Data preparation:

1. Log the data (in .pkl files) of your agents performing scheduling in flatland environments.
2. The app requires flatland and flatland-contrib libraries to process the data for the visualization. Hence them in your python environment.
3. This is a flask app. Hence you need to install flask in the python environment. Afer that just run app.py
4. Access the visualization from any web browser (recommended: Google Chrome). In the page you can upload your .pkl files for pre-processing and showing the visualization. Please note that it may take ~1 min for the pre-processing script.


Currently I have restricted uploading .pkl files >5MB. This can be changed in app.py file.
The project is in active development. Please feel free to report bugs and suggest features that you feel will be really useful for the community. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any quesetions or just drop a short message if you want to connect.
